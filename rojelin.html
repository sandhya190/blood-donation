    <h2 class="d"><u>care after blood donation:</u></h2>
    <p class="e">* Drink plenty of fluids to replenish the volume lost during donation.<br>
       * Avoid lifting heavy weights with the donation arm or participating in strenuous physical activities or sports after donation to prevent bruising of the venepuncture site and dizziness.<br>
       * The minimum time advised between two donations is 3 months. This gap helps blood regain the normal haemoglobin count.<br>* The age of the donor must be above 18 years and below 65 years of age.<br></p>
